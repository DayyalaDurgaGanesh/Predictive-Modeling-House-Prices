## 🔍 Workflow Summary

1. **Data Loading**  
   Loaded the dataset and explored the structure using `.info()`, `.head()`, and `.describe()`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values (if any)  
   - Performed basic EDA  
   - Checked correlation between features and target variable  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`  
   - Trained a Random Forest Regressor on the training data  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated the model using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
   - Plotted actual vs predicted values

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Improved performance using `GridSearchCV` to tune `n_estimators` and `max_depth`
